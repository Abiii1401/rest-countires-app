REST Countries API Implementation Documentation

1. API Overview
---------------
The application utilizes the REST Countries API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1) to fetch and display country information. The API provides comprehensive data about countries worldwide, including:
- Basic country information (name, population, region, capital)
- Country flags and images
- Detailed country data (languages, currencies, borders, subregion, TLD)

2. API Implementation
--------------------
The application implements the following API endpoints through a centralized API service:
- GET /all - Fetches all countries (implemented in getAllCountries)
- GET /name/{name} - Searches countries by name (implemented in searchCountriesByName)
- GET /region/{region} - Filters countries by region (implemented in filterCountriesByRegion)
- GET /alpha/{code} - Gets detailed country information (implemented in getCountryDetails)

3. Challenges Faced
------------------
a) Error Handling
- Challenge: API responses could be inconsistent or fail
- Solution: Implemented comprehensive error handling in api.js
- Added specific error messages for different scenarios (404, network errors, invalid responses)

b) Data Validation
- Challenge: Some countries had missing data (e.g., capital, currencies)
- Solution: Added null checks and fallback values (e.g., 'N/A' for missing data)
- Implemented data validation in CountryCard and CountryDetails components

c) State Management
- Challenge: Managing loading states and error states across components
- Solution: Implemented useState hooks for loading, error, and data states
- Added retry functionality for failed requests

4. Technical Solutions
---------------------
a) API Service Layer
- Created a centralized api.js service for all API calls
- Implemented axios for HTTP requests
- Added proper error handling and response validation

b) Component Implementation
- CountryCard: Displays basic country information with fallback values
- CountryDetails: Shows comprehensive country data with proper error handling
- Home: Implements filtering and search functionality

c) Testing
- Implemented Jest tests for API service
- Added mock data for testing different scenarios
- Tested error handling and edge cases

5. Future Improvements
---------------------
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Implement pagination for better performance with large datasets
- Add more detailed country information display

6. Conclusion
------------
The REST Countries API implementation provides a solid foundation for the application. The main challenges were around error handling and data validation, which were addressed through proper error handling and fallback values. The application is well-structured with a clear separation of concerns between API service, components, and state management.
